The solution involves verifying the native module is correctly linked and configured.  This usually requires steps within your native Android/iOS project files.  Here's a general outline (exact steps are library-specific):

1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the third-party library is correctly installed and included in your project's dependencies.
2. **Check Native Project Files:** For Android, examine your `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure the library's native components are correctly included.  For iOS, review your `ios/{YourProjectName}/Podfile` and ensure the library is listed as a pod, with correct dependencies. Run `pod install` in your `ios` directory after making changes to the Podfile. 
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, clean and rebuild your project.  The clean step can be essential to remove cached artifacts that might cause conflicts.
4. **Review Library Documentation:** Carefully follow the library's specific linking instructions.  These instructions might require manual configuration steps beyond simply adding dependencies. 
5. **Check for Environment Issues:** Uncommon errors might stem from issues outside the library itself, like incorrect environment variables or conflicting versions of other dependencies.
