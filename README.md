# React Native - Uncommon Native Module Linking Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon variation of the native module linking error in React Native and its solution.

The problem arises when a third-party library's native module isn't correctly linked or configured, leading to runtime errors where the JavaScript code cannot locate the native module or a method within it.

## Bug
The `NativeModuleBug.js` file contains code that attempts to use a native module. However, due to a misconfiguration or incomplete linking steps, this module will be unavailable.  This often manifests as an error similar to 'undefined is not an object' (evaluating '...nativeModule.method') at runtime. Specific error messages can vary greatly based on the library and how the link fails.

## Solution
The `NativeModuleBugSolution.js` file shows how to correctly link and configure the native module, resolving the runtime error. This solution requires careful attention to the specific instructions provided by the third-party library's documentation. 

**Note:** The exact solution depends heavily on the native module in question.  This example offers a general approach to resolving the error, but might need adjustments based on your specific scenario.  Always consult the library's documentation for precise linking instructions.
